# Lead Locator Lightning Web Components (LWC) App Final Code

This guide is the end result of the code generated for the Pluralsight course, "Building Your First Lightning Web Component for Salesforce". This is a beginners course and the primary audience are developers interested in learning how they can develop Lightning Web Components (LWC's) on the Salesforce PLatform. They are experienced software developers who are used to working with JavaScript and front-end web development tools, but may be only mildly familiar with Salesforce development. They also may or may not know anything about developing Aura components, which are the predecessors to Lightning Web Components. Because they may not be experienced with Salesforce development, the course will briefly cover getting setup in Salesforce and also will refer them to any additional support material that may be helpful to them.
